Tetris                     October 8, 2022
    Created and tested Tetris code with wall kicks and row clearing with constant time complexity
    Also created genetic algorithm to train and optimize neural networks to consistently score over 5000 tetrominoes
        
Critter Fest               September 23, 2022
    Created and tested interpreter to parse and implement custom critter commands. This interpreter considers the numerous edge cases in these commands and checks their validity
    Also created critter compiler to automatically write critter commands from higher-level methods
    Competed in Critter Fest against Turing's honor program

Random Writer              September 9, 2022
    Produced output texts that were similar to known pieces of work by matching the distribution of substrings of length k
    Optimized runtime down to O(n) using data structures

Image Manipulation         September 1, 2022
    Coded and tested Effect classes to manipulate images with effects such as NoRed, NoGreen, NoBlue, RedOnly, GreenOnly, BlueOnly, BlackAndWhite, VerticalReflect, HorizontalReflect, Grow, Shrink, Threshold, Blur, and Sharpen
