UT Austin Data Structures Projects - Fall 2022 - All in Java

Unable to publish actual code due to academic integrity policy

Web Crawler
    Coded and tested an html web crawler to index and query thousands of pages in O(1) time 
    Added support for phrase queries and basic operators such negation, union, and intersection
    Created an operation tree to parse complex queries based on order of operations and parentheses. 

Treaps
    Created and tests a custom "Treap" data structure which uses a heap to rebalance a binary search tree
    By giving nodes a random priority and maintaining both heap and binary search tree properties, operations were O(logn) time complexity
    These properties had to be maintained throughout a variety of operations including, merging, splitting, subtracting, iteration, 
    insertion and removal. 

Boggle
    Created and tested a Boggle game that effiently parses through hundreds of thousands of words in log(n) time complexity using a trie
    Also created a GUI to visualize the boggle grid and allow users to click-and-drag words

Tetris
    Created and tested Tetris code with wall kicks and row clearing with constant time complexity
    Also created genetic algorithm to train and optimize neural networks to consistently score over 5000 tetrominoes
        
Critter Fest
    Created and tested interpreter to parse and implement custom critter commands. This interpreter considers the numerous edge cases in these commands and checks their validity
    Also created critter compiler to automatically write critter commands from higher-level methods
    Competed in Critter Fest against Turing's honor program

Random Writer
    Produced output texts that were similar to known pieces of work by matching the distribution of substrings of length k
    Optimized runtime down to O(n) using data structures

Image Manipulation
    Coded and tested Effect classes to manipulate images with effects such as NoRed, NoGreen, NoBlue, RedOnly, GreenOnly, BlueOnly, BlackAndWhite, VerticalReflect, HorizontalReflect, Grow, Shrink, Threshold, Blur, and Sharpen
